## Instructions

To compile and run any of the programs which make use of the '../include/gorilla.h' header file.

Following are the steps 😄

1. copy and paste the contents of the program in " ../main.c "
2. locate the #include "../include/gorilla.h" and change it to #include "./include/gorilla.h"
3. if using linux, be sure to have Make installed on your machine and run ' make '.
4. if using windows, you should either use a compilation helper to make the object files of both the main.c and gorilla.c
    and then make an executable compiling them together.
5. Your executable is now named as "spacez", run it by running the command ./spacez
6. voila! 🚀️
